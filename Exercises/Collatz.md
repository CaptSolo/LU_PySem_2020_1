# Easy

Write a function (or class with method) to calculate the number of steps needed for the number to reach 1 using Collatz conjecture:
i.e. n/2 if even and 3n+1 if odd

## Intermediate

Write a function to return 10 numbers wiht the longest steps needed up to and including some number n(should work up to 100k at least).

## Harder

Visualize results up to 100k using some plotting library (Plotly, matplotlib, seaborn etc).
