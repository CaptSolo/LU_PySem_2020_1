# Functional Programming

* Pure Functions - do not have side effects, that is, they do not change the state of the program. Given the same input, a pure function will always produce the same output.
* Immutability - data cannot be changed after it is created.
* Higher Order Functions - functions can accept other functions as parameters and functions can return new functions as output. This allows us to abstract over actions, giving us flexibility in our code's behavior.
